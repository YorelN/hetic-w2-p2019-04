# YikeBoard - Landing page

  - [Babel] - The compiler to compile your JS files with es6, es7, JSX syntax to regular javascript
  - [Webpack] - The module binder which takes all your JS files from different directories and compiles them into a single      app.bundle.js (you can change the filename of course) so you can include it in a HTML page
